    <h1>Make a payment</h1>
    <p>To secure your space requests, we require pre-payment for the cost of that space. We can accept payment with
        your PayPal account, a major credit card (via PayPal but does not require a PayPal account),
        or via a cheque in the mail.</p>
    <p>The "suggested payment" below takes into account what spaces you have requested, what payments you have
        made so far, and what fees have already been deducted. You may choose to pay more if you desire; any
        over-payments will be returned to you at the completion of the show. Refunds for unused space requests
        will be made according to the Artist Agreement.</p>
    <p>To pay via PayPal, enter the desired payment and press "Pay via Paypal". You will be taken to the PayPal site
        to complete payment, and returned here afterwards.</p>
    <p>To pay via a mailed-in payment, enter the desired payment amount and press "Pay via Mail".</p>
    <p>Suggested payment: ${{ payment_remaining|floatformat:2 }}</p>
    <form method="post">{% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.non_field_errors }}
