Your username is: {{ user.username }}

.If you have not already logged in or created a password, please visit the following link:

{{ artshow_settings.SITE_ROOT_URL }}{% url "password_reset_confirm" uidb64=uid token=token %}

Note: That link is only valid for 3 days. You can always request another password-reset link to be sent to you from the site.

Once created, you can log-in at: {{ artshow_settings.SITE_ROOT_URL }}
